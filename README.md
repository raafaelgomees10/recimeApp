### Overview

This project is a web application built with Next.js to display a list of trending recipes, allowing users to filter these recipes by difficulty. The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with various features to enhance the user experience.

## :memo: Features

- **Animated Loading Screen:** Before rendering the components, an animated loading screen is displayed to improve the visual appeal of the application.

- **Data Fetch Simulation:** The data for the recipes is retrieved from a local JSON file, simulating an API request using getStaticProps to pre-fetch the data.

- **SEO Optimization:** A meta component is created to optimize the application's SEO, ensuring better visibility on search engines.

- **Styled Components:** The entire application uses styled-components for theming and global styles, providing a consistent look and feel across all devices.

- **Component Animations:** Various animations are implemented to enhance the rendering of components, making transitions smooth and visually appealing.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Sorting and Filtering:** Users can sort the recipe list by difficulty and by priority. The selected difficulty is stored in local storage, allowing the application to remember the user's last chosen setting on subsequent visits.

- **Recipe Modal:** A modal with detailed information about each recipe is available, providing users with more context on their chosen dishes.

- **Theme Switching:** Added a feature to toggle between light and dark themes using Redux for state management. Users can switch themes, and their preference is saved in local storage for a persistent experience.
